# Advent of Code 2023

This is my solutions for [Eric Wastl's](https://github.com/topaz) Advent of Code [challenge](https://adventofcode.com/).

>
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
